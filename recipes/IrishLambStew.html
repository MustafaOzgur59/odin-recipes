    <p>Hearty and traditional Irish lamb stew. It's best to refrigerate the stew overnight, and reheat it the next day for eating. This soup 'ages' well!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
        <li>6 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups diced carrots</li>
        <li>2 large onions, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>3 potatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.

        </li>
        <li>Put lamb, salt, pepper, and flour in large mixing bowl. Toss to coat meat evenly. Brown meat in frying pan with bacon fat.

        </li>
        <li>Place meat into stock pot (leave 1/4 cup of fat in frying pan). Add the garlic and yellow onion and saute till onion begins to become golden. Deglaze frying pan with 1/2 cup water and add the garlic-onion mixture to the stock pot with bacon pieces, beef stock, and sugar. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

        </li>
        <li>Add carrots, onions, potatoes, thyme, bay leaves, and wine to pot. Reduce heat, and simmer covered for 20 minutes until vegetables are tender.
